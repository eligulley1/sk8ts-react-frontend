However, I have not had any experience managing any full-stack applications, such as the one we will be developing for this project. Over the course of the project, I hope to gain more database experiecne, develop a more confident knowledge base in frontent development, as well as project management. I am also looking forward to the experience I will gain in server management, as deploying full-stack applications on a remote server is something I am unfamiliar with. Overall, I am looking forward to the ways this projcet will both hone my existing skills, as well as allow me to learn and understand new tools and applications."
